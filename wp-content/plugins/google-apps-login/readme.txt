Simple secure login and user management for Wordpress through your Google Apps domain 
(uses secure OAuth2, and MFA if enabled)

== Description ==

Google Apps Login allows existing Wordpress user accounts to login to your website using Google to securely authenticate their account. This means that if they are already logged into Gmail for example, they can simply click their way through the Wordpress login screen - no username or password is explicitly required!

Google Apps Login uses the latest **secure OAuth2 authentication recommended by Google**, including 2-factor Auth if enabled for your Google Apps accounts.

Plugin setup requires you to have admin access to any Google Apps domain, or a regular Gmail account, to register and obtain two simple codes from Google.

= Support and Premium features =

Full support and premium features are also available for purchase:

Eliminate the need for Google Apps domain admins to  separately manage WordPress user accounts, and get peace 
of mind that only authorized employees have access to the organizations's websites and intranet.

= Extensible Platform =

Google Apps Login allows you to centralize your site's Google functionality and build your own extensions, or use
third-party extensions, which require no configuration themselves and share the same user authentication and 
permissions that users already allowed for Google Apps Login itself.

Using our platform, your website appears to Google accounts as one unified 'web application', making it more secure 
and easier to manage.

[Google Drive Embedder](http://wp-glogin.com/wpgoogledriveembedder) is a free extension plugin allowing 
users to browse for Google Drive documents to embed directly in their posts or pages.

[Google Apps Directory](http://wp-glogin.com/wpgoogleappsdirectory) is a free extension plugin allowing 
logged-in users to search your Google Apps employee directory from a widget on your intranet or client site.

[Google Profile Avatars](http://wp-glogin.com/avatars/?utm_source=Login%20Readme%20Avatars&utm_medium=freemium&utm_campaign=Freemium) 
is available on our website. It displays users' Google profile photos in place of their avatars throughout your site.

Google Apps Login works on single or multisite WordPress websites or private intranets.

= Requirements =

One-click login will work for the following domains and user accounts:

*  Google Apps for Work
*  Google Apps for Business
*  Google Apps for Education
*  Google Apps for Non-profits
*  Personal gmail.com and googlemail.com emails

Google Apps Login uses the latest secure OAuth2 authentication recommended by Google. Other 3rd party authentication 
plugins may allow you to use your Google username and password to login, but they do not do this securely unless 
they also use OAuth2. This is discussed further in the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-apps-login/faq/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I obtain support for this product? =

Full support is available if you purchase the appropriate license from the author via:
[http://wp-glogin.com/google-apps-login-premium/](http://wp-glogin.com/google-apps-login-premium/?utm_source=Login%20Readme%20Premium&utm_medium=freemium&utm_campaign=Freemium)

Please feel free to email [support@wp-glogin.com](mailto:support@wp-glogin.com) with any questions,
as we may be able to help, but you may be required to purchase a support license if the problem
is specific to your installation or requirements.

We may occasionally be able to respond to support queries posted on the 'Support' forum here on the wordpress.org
plugin page, but we recommend sending us an email instead if possible.

= Is login restricted to the Google Apps domain I use to set up the plugin? =

No, once you set up the plugin, any WordPress accounts whose email address corresponds to *any* Google account, 
whether on a different Google Apps domain or even a personal gmail.com account, will be able to use 'Login with 
Google' to easily connect to your WordPress site.

However, our [premium plugin](http://wp-glogin.com/google-apps-login-premium/?utm_source=Login%20Readme%20FAQ&utm_medium=freemium&utm_campaign=Freemium) has features that greatly simplify 
your WordPress user management if your WordPress users are mostly on the same Google Apps domain(s).

= Does the plugin work with HTTP or HTTPS login pages? =

The plugin will work whether your site is configured for HTTP or HTTPS.

However, you may have configured your site to run so that the login pages 
can be accessed by *either* HTTP *or* HTTPS. In that case, you may run into problems. 
We recommend that you set [FORCE_SSL_ADMIN](http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL) 
or at least FORCE_SSL_LOGIN to true. This will ensure that all users are consistently using HTTPS 
for login.

You may then need to ensure the Redirect URL and Web Origin in the Google Cloud Console are
set as HTTPS (this will make sense if you follow the installation instructions again).

If for some reason you cannot set FORCE_SSL_ADMIN, then instead you can add two URLs to the Google
Cloud Console for each entry, e.g. Redirect URL = http://wpexample.com/wp-login.php, and
then add another one for https://wpexample.com/wp-login.php. Same idea for Web Origin.

= Does the plugin work on Multisite? =

It is written, tested, and secure for multisite WordPress, both for subdirectories and subdomains, and *must* be activated
network-wide for security reasons.

There are many different possible configurations of multisite WordPress, however, so you must test carefully if you 
have any other plugins or special setup.

In a multisite setup, you will see an extra option in Settings -> Google Apps Login, named 'Use sub-site specific callback 
from Google'. Read details in the configuration instructions (linked from the Settings page). This setting will need to be 
ON if you are using any domain mapping plugin, and extra Redirect URIs will need to be registered in Google Cloud Console.

= Is it secure? =

Yes, and depending on your setup, it can be much more secure than just using
WordPress usernames and passwords.

However, the author does not accept liability or offer any guarantee,
and it is your responsibility to ensure that your site is secure in the way you require.

In particular, other plugins may conflict with each other, and different WordPress versions and configurations
may render your site insecure.

= Does it conflict with any other plugins? =

Yes, sometimes conflicts can arise. We have built workarounds for some problems, and would always appreciate your feedback 
to resolve any issues you might encounter yourself.

One known issue is with iThemes Security: the settings 'filter suspicious query strings' and 'filter long URL strings' can 
both cause intermittent conflicts and should be turned off if you are happy with the implications.

Jonradio Private Site - does not interact well with any Single-Sign-On plugins including Google Apps Login

WP Email Login - incompatible with Google Apps Login

= How does it compare to other 3rd party auth plugins? =

Google Apps Login uses the latest secure OAuth2 authentication recommended by Google. Other 3rd party authentication plugins 
may allow you to use your Google username and password to login, but they do not always do this securely:

*  Other plugins: Users' passwords may be handled by your blog's server, potentially unencrypted. If these are compromised,
hackers would be able to gain access to your Google email accounts! This includes all 
[Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/products.html) (Gmail, Drive, Calendar 
etc), and any other services which use your Google account to login.

*  This plugin: Users' passwords are only ever submitted to Google itself, then Google is asked to authenticate the user to
your WordPress site. This means Multi-factor Authentication can still be used (if set up on your Google account). 
Your website only requires permission to authenticate the user and obtain basic profile data - it can never have access to 
your emails and other data.

= What are the system requirements? =

*  PHP 5.2.x or higher with JSON extensions
*  Wordpress 3.3 or above
*  Should no longer require CURL extension

And you will need a Google account to set up the plugin.

= I install the plugin, and my wp-login.php page is just blank =

The only time we've seen users experience a blank screen has been because they don't have CURL enabled on their server. 

Read [this article](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress) describing how you can debug and (hopefully) get 
an error message to see if that is the problem.

Or, since most often the problem is that CURL needs installing, it may be easier for you to jump straight to finding out 
whether CURL is installed, and enabling it if not. If that doesn't solve the problem, you may need to debug as above.

== Installation ==

To set up the plugin, you will need access to a Google Apps domain as an administrator, or just a regular Gmail account.

Easiest way:

1. Go to your WordPress admin control panel's plugin page
1. Search for 'Google Apps Login'
1. Click Install
1. Click Activate on the plugin
1. Go to 'Google Apps Login' under Settings in your Wordpress admin area
1. Follow the instructions on that page to obtain two codes from Google, and also submit two URLs back to Google

If you cannot install from the WordPress plugins directory for any reason, and need to install from ZIP file:

1. Upload `googleappslogin` directory and contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload the ZIP file directly in
the Plugins section of your Wordpress admin
1. Follow the instructions from step 4 above

Personalized instructions to configure the plugin by registering your site with Google Apps are linked from 
the WordPress admin panel once you have activated the plugin. For a (non-personalized) preview of these instructions 
please [click here](http://wp-glogin.com/installing-google-apps-login/basic-setup/).
